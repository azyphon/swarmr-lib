"""Interpreting a LangGraph update stream as delegation events.

One place decides what a stream chunk *means*; the terminal renderer and the MCP
job log both consume the result. Without this, each would re-derive subagent
attribution from raw messages and the two would drift.

LangGraph's subgraph namespace does not carry the subagent's name, so
attribution is recovered by mapping each `task` tool_call_id to the
subagent_type it was dispatched with. The matching ToolMessage then identifies
the verdict exactly, even with several subagents running concurrently.
